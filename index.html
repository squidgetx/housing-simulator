    Contact with the criminal justice system varies dramatically between racial groups. Under NYC's Stop + Frisk policy, blacks were stopped by police over 8x as much as whites despite being no more likely to be arrested.

    Unfortunately, even encounters that do not result in arrest can have downstream impacts.

    Many municipalities in the midwestern US are beginning to create crime free housing ordinances that require private landlords to exclude tenants that aren't considered "crime free".
    In many areas this means that those with traffic infractions or even a history simple interactions that did not result in arrests or convictions are denied access to housing in certain communities.

    The combination of these laws and bias in policing leads to communities that become racially segregated despite the fact that the "crime free housing ordinance" itself is race-neutral.
